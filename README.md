# Data-Mining-Survival-Prediction  

## Project Objective  
This project aims to learn how to build an accurate classification model, evaluate the model performance, and analyze the important features of the given dataset.  

## Data  
1. The number of the training set and the testing set is 44,939 and 19,260, respectively.  
2. This dataset, including demographics, medical examination results, and so on, consists of patientsâ€™ information on hospital admission.


## Steps  
### 1. Data pre-preprocessing   
### 2. Classification (machine learning algorithms)  
### 3. Results & Analysis  
- Cross-validation with AUROC and F1 score
- Explainable experiment: Do feature importance
